# Automated JavaScript Testing
This project uses Jasmine as our testing framework for javascript code with this project's codebase.
Jasmine was selected for the following reasons:
1. The production server is not compatible with Node.js or npm, which disqualifies many testing frameworks.
2. Jasmine has a standalone version and can be ran in the browser.

## Running The Tests
Jasmine will work on many different browsers: Safari, Chrome, Firefox, Micorsoft Edge, and new Internet Explorer.

Open up whichever browser you choose and navigate to the following page:
```
http://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~lords/scheduleit/jasmine/SpecRunner.html?random=false
```
or [Click this Link](http://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~lords/scheduleit/jasmine/SpecRunner.html?random=false) to be taken to the above URL.


## Options
In the top right of the testing webpage, you'll see an "Options" button which gives you some choices on how the tests are run and results displayed.
